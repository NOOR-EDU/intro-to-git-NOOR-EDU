Hi, 
I am Noor Ali
# What I Learned

I learned the basics of Git and how to use it for version control. I now understand how to create a repository, commit changes, and push them to a remote repository.

# What I'm Still Confused About

I'm still a bit confused about branching and merging in Git. I need more practice to fully grasp these concepts.
